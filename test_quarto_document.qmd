I'm mostly just creating this document to see what it looks like on GitHub. I'm trying to compare Quarto to Rmd. One aspect I'm interested in is how nicely it plays with version control and GitHub. It's very easy to view the content of my Rmd documents on GitHub. I'm checking to see how easy it is to view the content of my qmd documents as well.

Another issue I need to look into is creating templates for Quarto documents.


## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this 

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
